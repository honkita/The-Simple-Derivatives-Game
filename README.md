# The Simple Derivatives Game
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honkita/MD-Links/main/Pixel_Unmaintained.svg)

Math game from COMPSCI 1XD3
The elm.json file must be run in main directory.

## Origin
This application was created as the final project for the COMPSCI 1XD3 course taught by Professor Christopher Anand. This was the culminating assignment that was supposed to be created in groups of five people. I created this application myself for the code submission. 

## Purpose
This is a derivatives game that is meant to teach high school students derivatives. The main gameplay is a multiple choice picker to pick the correct derivative. There are two main game modes, which are freeplay and normal play. The difference is that for normal play, the player has three lives and losing all would cause a game over. 

## Coding Language
Elm was the language of choice for this application because it was the language enforced in the course. Had this have been coded in any other language, it would have taken at most 5 hours. Due to Elm's nature as a functional language, it took four months.
